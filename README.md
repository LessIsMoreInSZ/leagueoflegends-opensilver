## Project Introduction

Our journey with XAML-based technologies began with WPF in 2008, and we've consistently demonstrated how powerful architectural patterns can transcend platform boundaries. The success of our WPF-based League of Legends client project has proven that well-structured XAML applications can be effectively adapted to various platforms - from WinUI 3 and UWP to cross-platform solutions like Uno Platform. Now, with OpenSilver 3.1, we're taking this same architectural excellence to the web.

This OpenSilver version represents more than just a port - it's a testament to the versatility of our architectural approach. By leveraging the same patterns that made our WPF version successful, we've created a web-based implementation that maintains the rich user experience and complex functionality of the original, while taking advantage of OpenSilver's modern web capabilities.

What makes this project particularly significant is how it demonstrates the portability of well-designed XAML applications. The same modular architecture, CustomControls, and state management patterns that worked effectively in our desktop applications have been seamlessly translated to the web environment. This successful transition showcases how developers can leverage their existing XAML and C# expertise to create sophisticated web applications without sacrificing the architectural principles that make desktop applications robust and maintainable.

The Jamesnet.Core framework, based on .NET Standard 2.0, continues to serve as our foundation, proving its versatility by working seamlessly across WPF, Uno Platform, and now OpenSilver. This consistency in our core framework demonstrates how well-designed architecture can adapt to new platforms while maintaining its fundamental strengths.

This OpenSilver implementation opens new possibilities for web-based XAML applications, showing that the gap between desktop and web development can be bridged while maintaining the high standards of application architecture we've established in our other platform implementations.
